# Fixes Applied to Force WKB Execution

## Problem Identified

The system was **mentioning** approximation methods (WKB, perturbation, variational) but **NOT EXECUTING** them. The iterations would say:
- "We will apply WKB approximation..."
- "The next step is to use perturbation theory..."
- "We should employ the variational method..."

But then **never actually performed the calculations**. This resulted in:
- ‚ùå No actual WKB ansatz substitution
- ‚ùå No eikonal equation derivation
- ‚ùå No turning point calculations
- ‚ùå No Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
- ‚ùå Just repeated problem restatements

## Root Cause

The prompts were too permissive and allowed the model to:
1. **Plan** to use a method without **executing** it
2. Restate the problem multiple times
3. Say "it can be shown" without showing
4. Mention methods without applying them

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced System Preamble (lib/schrodinger/solver.js)

**Added to FORBIDDEN section:**
```
- SAYING you will apply a method without ACTUALLY APPLYING IT
- Restating the problem instead of solving it
```

**Added CRITICAL execution instructions:**
```
CRITICAL: DO NOT just say "we will apply WKB" - ACTUALLY APPLY IT with explicit calculations:
- For WKB: Write œà(x) = A(x)exp(iS(x)/‚Ñè), expand S(x), derive the eikonal equation, 
  find turning points, apply connection formulas
- For perturbation: Write H = H‚ÇÄ + ŒªH‚ÇÅ, expand E and œà in powers of Œª, 
  derive correction terms explicitly
- For variational: Choose trial function, compute ‚ü®H‚ü©, minimize with respect to parameters, 
  derive energy bounds
```

### 2. Enhanced Iteration Prompt

**Added CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT block:**
```
CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT - DO NOT JUST PLAN, EXECUTE:
- FORBIDDEN: Saying "we will apply WKB" or "we will use perturbation theory" 
  without ACTUALLY DOING IT
- REQUIRED: If you mention an approximation method, you MUST execute it with 
  explicit calculations in THIS iteration

For WKB:
  1. Write œà(x) = A(x)exp(iS(x)/‚Ñè)
  2. Substitute into Schr√∂dinger equation
  3. Derive eikonal equation S'(x)¬≤ = 2m(E-V)
  4. Solve for S(x) explicitly
  5. Find turning points x‚ÇÅ,x‚ÇÇ where E=V(x)
  6. Apply Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization ‚à´p(x)dx = (n+1/2)œÄ‚Ñè

For perturbation:
  1. Write H = H‚ÇÄ + ŒªH‚ÇÅ
  2. Expand E_n = E_n‚ÅΩ‚Å∞‚Åæ + ŒªE_n‚ÅΩ¬π‚Åæ + Œª¬≤E_n‚ÅΩ¬≤‚Åæ
  3. Compute E_n‚ÅΩ¬π‚Åæ = ‚ü®œà_n‚ÅΩ‚Å∞‚Åæ|H‚ÇÅ|œà_n‚ÅΩ‚Å∞‚Åæ‚ü© with explicit integrals

For variational:
  1. Choose trial œà_trial(x;Œ±)
  2. Compute ‚ü®H‚ü© = ‚à´œà*Hœàdx / ‚à´œà*œàdx
  3. Take ‚àÇ‚ü®H‚ü©/‚àÇŒ± = 0
  4. Solve for optimal Œ±

SHOW THE ACTUAL CALCULATIONS, not just the method name
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken):
```
Iteration 1: "We will apply WKB approximation..."
Iteration 2: "The WKB method is suitable for this problem..."
Iteration 3: "Using WKB, we can find the eigenfunctions..."
Iteration 4: "The next step is to apply Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization..."
Result: NO ACTUAL WKB CALCULATION
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Iteration 1: Setup Schr√∂dinger equation with m(x) and V(x)
Iteration 2: Write WKB ansatz œà(x) = A(x)exp(iS(x)/‚Ñè)
Iteration 3: Substitute into equation, derive S'(x)¬≤ = 2m(x)(E-V(x))
Iteration 4: Solve for S(x) = ‚à´‚àö[2m(x)(E-V(x))]dx
Iteration 5: Find turning points where E = V(x)
Iteration 6: Apply Bohr-Sommerfeld: ‚à´_{x1}^{x2} ‚àö[2m(x)(E-V(x))]dx = (n+1/2)œÄ‚Ñè
Iteration 7: Solve for energy eigenvalues E_n
Iteration 8: Construct eigenfunctions with connection formulas
Result: COMPLETE WKB SOLUTION WITH ENERGY SPECTRUM
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: PDM Quartic Problem (Position-Dependent Mass)

**Problem:**
```
Solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for a system with effective mass 
m(x) = m‚ÇÄ(1 + gx) in a linear potential V(x) = cx.
Determine the eigenfunctions and energy spectrum.
```

**Expected WKB Solution Steps:**

1. **Setup:** Write time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation
   ```
   -‚Ñè¬≤/2 d/dx[1/m(x) dœà/dx] + V(x)œà = Eœà
   ```

2. **WKB Ansatz:** Assume semi-classical solution
   ```
   œà(x) = A(x)exp(iS(x)/‚Ñè)
   ```

3. **Eikonal Equation:** Substitute and expand in powers of ‚Ñè
   ```
   [S'(x)]¬≤ = 2m(x)[E - V(x)]
   S'(x) = ¬±‚àö[2m‚ÇÄ(1+gx)(E-cx)]
   ```

4. **Classical Action:**
   ```
   S(x) = ‚à´‚àö[2m‚ÇÄ(1+gx)(E-cx)]dx
   ```

5. **Turning Points:** Solve E = V(x)
   ```
   E = cx ‚Üí x_turn = E/c
   ```

6. **Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization:**
   ```
   ‚à´_{x1}^{x2} ‚àö[2m‚ÇÄ(1+gx)(E-cx)]dx = (n+1/2)œÄ‚Ñè
   ```

7. **Energy Eigenvalues:** Solve for E_n
   ```
   E_n ‚âà [some function of n, m‚ÇÄ, g, c, ‚Ñè]
   ```

8. **Eigenfunctions:** Construct with connection formulas
   ```
   œà_n(x) ‚âà [amplitude] √ó [oscillatory in classically allowed region]
                        √ó [exponentially decaying in forbidden region]
   ```

### Test 2: Verify Execution vs Planning

**Check the LaTeX output for:**

‚úÖ **Good signs (execution):**
- Explicit WKB ansatz: `œà(x) = A(x)e^{iS(x)/‚Ñè}`
- Eikonal equation derived: `S'(x)¬≤ = 2m(E-V)`
- Integral for S(x) shown: `S(x) = ‚à´‚àö[2m(E-V)]dx`
- Turning points calculated: `x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ` where `E = V(x)`
- Bohr-Sommerfeld applied: `‚à´p dx = (n+1/2)œÄ‚Ñè`
- Energy eigenvalues: `E_n = ...` (explicit formula)

‚ùå **Bad signs (planning only):**
- "We will apply WKB..."
- "The next step is to use..."
- "It can be shown that..."
- "Using the WKB approximation, we find..."
- No explicit ansatz substitution
- No eikonal equation
- No turning point calculation

## Success Criteria

The LaTeX output should contain:
1. ‚úÖ WKB ansatz equation
